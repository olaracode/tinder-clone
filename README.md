This project had the goal to learn the use of react functional components, material U.I and Firebase, React-Router.

This project was made following the tutorial made by cleverprogrammer.

It's a copy of the basic UI used by tinder, it is not functional as it only intended to work as an introduction to the use of material Ui and Basic Firebase.

It is divided into several small components. The main component is App, there all the components start comming together and it is the Main "/" of the SPA style app that was built. 

The chat Screen is hardcoded, same as must of the information. The future of the project should be to implement more interaction between the app and the firebase database.
